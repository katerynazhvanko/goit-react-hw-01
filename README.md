# React + Vite = Homework 1

Task 1 : Profile in soc media with information about user. 
Task 2 : List of friends reflects which friend is online and offline. Was used a tiny utility for constructing className strings conditionally -> clsx.
Task 3 : History of transaction in table format with type, amount and currency of transaction. 

Was used css.module for styling tasks. For live pages was used Vercel - to deploy and run the user facing parts of applications.
